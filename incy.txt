Incy Wincy Spider climed up the water spout

<<<<<<< HEAD
Then Incy Wincy Spider did not climb up the spout again --*

=======
Down came the rain and washed the spider out

Out came summer and dried up all the fun
<<<<<<< HEAD
Then Incy Wincy Spider did not climb up the spout again 
Then Incy Wincy Spider climbed up on a rock and did not like the view
I'm not sure if this will work but it's worth a shot as on the rock he meet an Ant

﻿Summer wins

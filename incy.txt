Incy Wincy Spider climed up the water spout

Down came the rain and washed the spider out

<<<<<<< HEAD
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain
Then Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the spout again

Incy Wincy Spider Loved to browse the web,
Needless to say it was developing again.
Out came summer and dried up all the fun
Then Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the spout again
